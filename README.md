# joglsailboat
Simulation of a sailboat with a 3D representation using the JOGL library.

This project is a port in Java of a sailboat simulator written in C++ by the Robotic team of the ENSTA Bretagne (Brest, France). The whole set of mechanical expressions has been redefined.

# Pre-requesite

In order to compile and run the project, you need to download and configure the JOGL library in your development environment.

JOGL can be downloaded [here](https://jogamp.org/deployment/jogamp-current/archive/jogamp-all-platforms.7z)

To configure your development environment check [this page](https://jogamp.org/wiki/index.php/Setting_up_a_JogAmp_project_in_your_favorite_IDE).

# Acknowledgement

I wish to thank the Robotic team of the ENSTA Bretagne for letting me use the graphical part of their sailboat simulator.
I also thank Bruno Aizier and CÃ©dric Doudard for their help about modeling the mechanical equations of a sailboat.
